Process-Injection
=================

THIS IS A PERSONAL PROJECT. ANY CODE WITHIN IS NOT INHERENTLY MY OWN, BUT PROPERTY OF ITS RESPECTIVE AUTHOR.

UPDATE
======

If you're an employer or friend, here to pour over my old work, feel free. However, note that this was all written as I was still very new to the experience of "programming," and as such, much of this code is copied haphazardly from various stackoverflow and blog posts.

In the end, this is a project with the simple goal of helping me learn more about my strengths and weaknesses in C++, and in the end, this was done in 2015.

I'd like to think I've learned a lot since these days.
